        "ReLU is defined as the element-wise maximum between the input and a tensor of zeros. It's one of the simplest types of **nonlinear activation functions**. These are essential because linear operations compose to make more linear operations, which is very limiting. On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions. We'll explore this idea more when we study circuits in next week's interpretability material."

We'll create one of the simplest networks which can be used to separate data that is non-linearly separable: a single linear layer, followed by a nonlinear function (ReLU), followed by another linear layer. This type of architecture (alternating linear layers and nonlinear functions) is often called a **multi-layer perceptron** (MLP).\n",

We can then use the **softmax function** $x_i \\to \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_i e^{x_i}}$ to turn these values into probabilities. However, it's common practice for the output of a neural network to be the values before we take softmax, rather than after. We call these pre-softmax values the **logits**.\n",

        "The `torchvision` package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision, and `torchvision.transforms` provides access to a suite of functions for preprocessing data. We define a transform for the MNIST data (which is applied to each image in the dataset) by composing `ToTensor` (which converts a `PIL.Image` object into a PyTorch tensor) and `Normalize` (which takes arguments for the mean and standard deviation, and performs the linear transformation `x -> (x - mean) / std`). For the latter, we use `0.1307` and `0.3081` which are the empirical mean & std of the raw data (so after this transformation, the data will have mean 0 and variance 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we define our datasets using `torchvision.datasets`. The first argument tells us where to save our data to (so that when we run this in the future we won't have to re-save it), and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset. We also use `Subset` which allows us to return a slice of the dataset rather than the whole thing (because our model won't need much data to train!).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, since our dataset only allows for iteration over individual datapoints, we wrap it in `DataLoader` which enables iteration over **batches**. It also provides useful arguments like `shuffle`, which determine whether we randomize the order after each epoch. The code above demonstrates iteration over the dataset & dataloader respectively, showing how the first element in the dataloader's first batch equals the first element in the dataset (note that this wouldn't be true for the training set, because we've shuffled it).\n",

        "\n",
        "It's common to see batch sizes which are powers of two. The motivation is for efficient GPU utilisation, since processor architectures are normally organised around powers of 2, and computational efficiency is often increased by having the items in each batch split across processors. Or at least, that's the idea. The truth is a bit more complicated, and some studies dispute whether it actually saves time, so at this point it's more of a standard convention than a hard rule which will always lead to more efficient training.\n",

        "\n",
        "Normalization isn't strictly necessary for this reason, because any rescaling of an input vector can be effectively undone by the network learning different weights and biases. But in practice, it does usually help speed up convergence.\n",

        "There are some more advanced features of `tqdm` too, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If you define the progress bar `pbar = tqdm(...)` before your iteration, then you have the option of adding extra information to it using `pbar.set_description` or `pbar.set_postfix`\n",
        "- You can specify the total number of iterations with `tqdm(iterable, total=...)`; this is actually very important when the iterable is something like `enumerate(...)` which doesn't have a length attribute, since tqdm will usually try and infer the total from calling `len` on the iterable you pass it.\n",

For now, [this page](https://wandb.ai/wandb/common-ml-errors/reports/How-To-Use-GPU-with-PyTorch---VmlldzozMzAxMDk) should provide a basic overview of how to use your GPU. A few things to be aware of here:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `to` method is really useful here - it can move objects between different devices (i.e. CPU and GPU) *as well as* changing a tensor's datatype.\n",
        "    * Note that `to` is never inplace for tensors (i.e. you have to call `x = x.to(device)`), but when working with models, calling `model = model.to(device)` or `model.to(device)` are both perfectly valid.\n",
        "* Errors from having one tensor on cpu and another on cuda are very common. Some useful practices to avoid this:\n",
        "    * Throw in assert statements, to make sure tensors are on the same device\n",
        "    * Remember that when you initialise an array (e.g. with `t.zeros` or `t.arange`), it will be on CPU by default.\n",
        "    * Tensor methods like [`new_zeros`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_zeros.html) or [`new_full`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_full.html) are useful, because they'll create tensors which match the device and dtype of the base tensor.\n",

This will make it easier to add features like logging and validation, and will also make our code more readable and easier to refactor. However, for now we've kept things simple."

While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",

This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",

Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

        "Edit the `train` function above to include a validation loop. Train your model, making sure you measure the accuracy at the end of each epoch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few tips to help you:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation (we usually set `shuffle=False` for testsets).\n",
        "    * You can set the same batch size as for your training set (we'll discuss more optimal choices for this later in the course).\n",
        "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
        "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
        "    * Computing accuracy is meant to be a very short operation, so you shouldn't need a progress bar.\n",
        "    * You can wrap your forward pass in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate)."

        "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input. The kernel contains our learned weights, and we slide that kernel across our input, with each output value being computed by a sumproduct of the kernel values and the corresponding patch in the input. Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

The left branch is fully shape preserving if and only if `first_stride == 1` and `in_feats == out_feats`. If this is true then we do set the right branch to be the identity (that's what the \"OPTIONAL\" annotation refers to), but if this isn't true then we set the right branch to be a 1x1 convolution with stride `first_stride`, zero padding, and mapping from `in_feats` to `out_feats`, followed by a batchnorm layer. This is in a sense the simplest operation we can get which matches the left branch shape, since the convolution is basically just a downsampling operation (keeping pixels based on a `::first_stride` slice across the height and width dimensions)."

We can see that the first blockgroup only had left branches but no right branches (this is because for the very first blockgroup we had `in_feats == out_feats == 64` and also `first_strides_per_group[0] == 1`, meaning this first blockgroup was shape-preserving and it didn't need a right branch). So it's the presence of a right branch that's causing the mismatch.\n",

But the parameter from the PyTorch model has shape `(128, 64, 3, 3)`, i.e. it's a convolutional weight with a 3x3 kernel, so must be from the left branch (it also matches the naming convention for the left-branch convolutional weight from the first blockgroup - row index 3 in the dataframe). So we've now figured out what the problem is: **your implementation defines the right branch before the left branch in the the `ResidualBlock.__init__` method, and to match param orders with the PyTorch model you should swap them around.**\n",

When we call `loss.backward()` in our training loop (or when this is implicitly called by our PyTorch Lightning trainer), this propagates gradients from our `loss` scalar back to all parameters in our model. If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",

The purpose of the stride exercises is more to give you an appreciation for what's going on under the hood, so that we can build layers of abstraction on top of that during the rest of this week (and by extension this course). I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better."
